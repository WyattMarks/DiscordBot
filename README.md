# DiscordBot

A discord bot I've spent about a week on. It uses Discord.NET as the basis.

If I have him running, he's active at Data#6434 on Discord. Feel free to add him to your server.

If you build this, he needs the fork of Genbox.Wikipedia on my GitHub. It supports getting the extract of a page, unlike the original.
